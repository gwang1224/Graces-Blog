My bestie partner Rachit!

Rachit helped me with numerous problems this week including:
- My website suddenly lost all the hard work and styles I put into it.
- Problem where the deployed github pages server didn't maintain the theme, although the theme works in local server
    - Rachit fixed this with the config.yml folder
